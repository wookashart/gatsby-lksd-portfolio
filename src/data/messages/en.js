    aboutDescription: 'I started my adventure with creating websites at the end of 2016 and I immediately realized that this is something I want to do, because it gives me great pleasure.

Before I took care of web sites, I was designing gardens, that\'s why the sense of aesthetics is deeply rooted in me. I always put my whole heart into the work I do. Going with the times, I am up to date with the latest trends and technologies to strwny which create fit in the current trends of appearance and functionality. If you want to get to know me better - write.',
